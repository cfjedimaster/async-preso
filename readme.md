## Async JavaScript Presentation

This is a slide deck related to my presentation on handling async code in JS. It's meant to introduce the problem, discuss Promises as a solution, and then Async/Await. I want to give people the basics as well as links to go for deeper resources.

The stuff below is my notes, probably rough. :)

Things I want to cover:

How to handle N promises.
How to handle N async calls.
Discuss parallel versus one by one execution (async foreach shows this well).

Code will probably be in CodePen
